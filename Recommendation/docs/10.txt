'Pakistanis themselves give a bad name to Pakistan and Islam,' says Malala Yousafzai
NEW DELHI: Referring to the recent mob-lynching of a university student for 'blasphemy', Pakistani Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai, in a strongly-worded video message, said no one but Pakistan is to blame for the poor image it has in the world.
"We talk about Islamophobia and how people give a bad name to our country and our religion. No one is giving a bad name to our country or our religion. We are doing that all by ourselves. We are enough for that," Yousafzai said in the video message.

On Thursday, Mashaal Khan, a 23-year-old journalism student in Pakistan was murdered by a screaming lynch mob+ on his university premises. The mob said Mashaal posted 'blasphemous' content on his Facebook account. Not only did the lynch mob beat to a pulp and then shoot dead Mashaal, it then continued to pound the boy's lifeless body with sticks - all of this in the clear light of day.
Yousafzai said that she spoke to the murdered student's father and said his message was that peace and tolerance should prevail despite the horrific incident.
