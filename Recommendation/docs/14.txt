The Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that disappeared nearly three years ago with 239 people on board crashed into the Indian Ocean at high speed rather than gliding down gently, an analysis of the debris found.
The conclusion from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau made public Wednesday is based on analysis of 20 pieces of debris believed to have come from the Boeing 777. Pieces of debris have washed ashore on the east and south coasts of Africa, the east coast of Madagascar and the islands of Mauritius, Reunion and Rodriguez since the plane disappeared March 8, 2014, during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.
Two sections of flaps were traced specifically to the lost plane by their markings.
