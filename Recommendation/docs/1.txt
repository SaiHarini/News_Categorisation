Reliance Jio chargeable & limited now:
Here's how Prime members can check data usage After the extension period by Reliance Jio ends, there will be data charges on data usage. It will no longer be free nor be unlimited. Here's how to keep a track of the internet usage on your mobile phones. Reliance Jio has not left any stone unturned when it comes to luring people into its highly addictive internet data packs. Now that the freebies by Jio are going to be chargeable, you will be bound to pay for them. Especially now, when you are totally into it. Reliance Jio has extended its free offers by three months for its Prime members. So if a user has paid the Prime membership fee and done a minimum recharge of Rs 303, then under the Summer Surprise offer the user will get another three months of free service. This essentially means that whichever pack you have done your recharge on, will start being applied from July. After you opt for being a Jio Prime member, by paying the Rs 99 fee, you need to go for a further recharge. You can then select the Rs 303 recharge plan, as you will get the Happy new Year offer of 1GB free internet per day for the next three months. Or you could choose tariff plans of a higher value. But where does internet usage stop?
