United Airlines Changes Policy for Displacing Passengers
A few days after a passenger was violently dragged off of a United Airlines plane, the company has changed their policies on how they displace travelers.

United Airlines crew members will not be able to bump a passenger who is already seated in one of the airline's planes, according to NPR. The policy change was first reported by TMZ.
NPR reported that United updated its policy "to make sure crews traveling on our aircraft are booked at least 60 minutes prior to departure. This ensures situations like Flight 3411 never happen again."
If a crew member isn't booked an hour before the flight, then they will have to wait for the next available plane.

Meanwhile, Delta Airlines will offer up to nearly $10,000 to passengers to give up their seats on overbooked flights, Fortune reports. The airline raised its compensation limit by thousands of dollars, according to the Associated Press.

Facebook footage showed a screaming man being pulled from his seat on an overbooked, Louisville-bound flight from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Sunday. He was asked to give up his seat so one of four United employees could board the flight, the Associated Press reported.
