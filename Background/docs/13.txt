Star Wars: The Last Jedi Trailer Sends the Internet Into a Frenzy of Excitement
Disney debuted its highly-anticipated first trailer for "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" at a fan event in the United States Friday, sending the Internet into a frenzy of excitement - and speculation.

The footage from the eighth installment in the blockbuster space opera, due for release on December 15, was shown at the "Star Wars Celebration" gathering in Orlando marking the 40th anniversary of the original movie.

The 132-second clip teases Luke Skywalker's first meeting with Rey as he teaches her the ways of the Force, opening with the young apprentice on the island where fans saw her find Luke at the end of "The Force Awakens."
