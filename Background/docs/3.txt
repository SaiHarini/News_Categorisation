Here's how Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio may generate over Rs 20,000 crore in one year
When Ambani announced the arrival of Jio in the Indian market, it completely disrupted the telecom sector, and with several extensions of the trial period, the company continues to defy every logic of economics.
Was RIL Chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani, the Indian businessman of the year? Inarguably, so. When Ambani announced the arrival of Jio in the Indian market, it completely disrupted the telecom sector, and with several extensions of the trial period, the company continues to defy every logic of economics. Interestingly, even after spending a humongous amount of resources on Jio, there was practically no negative effect on the man himself. As a matter of fact, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Ambani's personal wealth increased by $6 billion in a year. According to Bloomberg, the rise in wealth can be attributed to his huge stakes in Reliance Industries. It has been said that even though Jio was a free service, it aided RIL's stocks to roar. This is just a highlight of the great business sense that the country's richest person has.
