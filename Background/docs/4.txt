Reliance Jio set-top box leaked online, DTH services coming soon?
Reliance Jio's JioTV is said to offer more than 360 channels, at least 50 of which will be in HD.
Reliance Jio is preparing to enter in to the DTH (Direct to Home) service space, given new leaked images of its set-top box have started to surface online. The new pictures are quite different from the ones leaked earlier, which had revealed a round set-top box. Leaked in February, the images had a Jio-branded remote along with set-top box which had a circular top. The device, which deviates from the standard rectangular design for set-top boxes, looks customised for Jio customers.
However, new leaked images suggest Jio might stick with a rectangular design for its set-top box after all. The pictures show a blue box with Reliance Jio branding on top as well as new set-top box. The device has a number of ports including a standard cable connector, HDMI, USB, as well as audio and video output. Thereâ€™s also an Ethernet port, which will allow users to connect to a modem to offer broadband.
