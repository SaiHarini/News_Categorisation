Rajya Rani Express derailment: Cannot rule out sabotage, say Rampur police

New Delhi/Rampur: A three-feet portion of the track where eight coaches of the Rajya Rani Express derailed near Rampur on Saturday was missing and sabotage angle cannot be ruled out, Uttar Pradesh police said.

KK Chaudhri, Rampur SP, who visited the accident site, said the track was found broken and some of its portion buried. “Sabotage cannot be ruled out,” he told PTI when asked about possible reasons behind the accident.

A railway source in New Delhi also said the derailment was caused, prima facie, due to the rail fracture. “Weld was found broken. But the reason of the fracture would be ascertained through investigation only,” the source said. Chaudhri said an investigation has been initiated and entire fact would come out only after its completion.

The accident occurred two kilometers from Rampur junction and about 100 meters from the Kosi river bridge.

Railway minister Suresh Prabhu and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath have announced a compensation of Rs50,000 for each of the seriously injured passengers in the derailment of the train. The railway minister has also ordered an enquiry into the accident.
